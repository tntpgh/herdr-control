# ---- submit confirmation (send-to-agent.sh) ---------------------------------
#
# A snapshot of the bottom of the pane, filtered to strip volatile furniture
# that changes independent of whether anything was actually submitted — the
# OMC/tmux status bar's live elapsed-time and context-percentage counters,
# the spinner glyph — but DELIBERATELY KEEPING `❯`-prefixed lines. That is the
# opposite choice from prompt_context above: prompt_context strips them
# because it wants the agent's own words; this wants exactly the composer's
# own line, since "unsent text still sitting there" is the whole signal.
#
# Why this exists: send-to-agent.sh's Enter-retry loop used to detect
# "submitted" by grepping for ONE specific artifact (Claude's "[Pasted text"
# paste-debounce placeholder). For ordinary short text there is no such
# artifact, so that check reported "clear" — and therefore SUBMITTED — after
# the very first Enter, whether or not the Enter actually landed. Comparing
# two of these snapshots instead (before/after an Enter) catches that
# honestly: a message truly stuck in the composer produces byte-identical
# snapshots and correctly keeps retrying; a real submit changes the bottom of
# the pane (new response text, a fresh empty prompt, or the debounce artifact
# clearing) and is detected the same way regardless of which of those it was.
#
# The status-bar/spinner strip is what makes this safe to compare across a
# multi-second retry gap: without it, session-elapsed-minutes or a context%
# counter ticking over between two reads would register as "something
# changed" and falsely declare an unsubmitted message SUBMITTED — a worse
# failure than the one this replaces, since it actively lies about delivery.

# --- menu-shape prompts (no numbered options at all) ------------------------
#
# Not every agent renders a numbered list. omp's tool-approval prompt is an
# up/down + Enter menu with no numbers and no bare-digit convention at all —
# verified live 2026-07-31 against `omp --approval-mode always-ask`: an
# "Allow tool: <name>" header, a blank separator, one row per option, a
# blank separator, and a "... enter select ..." footer. The CURRENTLY
# HIGHLIGHTED row is the only one carrying an SGR 24-bit background-colour
# escape (\e[48;2;R;G;Bm) — every other row is unstyled plain text, which is
# why this needs --format ansi; prompt_options above (plain --source
# visible) cannot see it at all.
#
# Provides: prompt_menu_options <pane>  -> "N<TAB>label" per row, 1-based,
#             top-to-bottom — the SAME numbering convention as
#             prompt_options, so a caller (herdr-select.sh, a Slack "reply
#             1/2/3") never needs to know which mechanism it is driving.
#           prompt_menu_selected <pane> -> the 1-based row currently
#             highlighted, or empty if no menu is showing OR the highlight
#             could not be determined — never guess a position.
#           prompt_menu_question <pane> -> the header/detail lines, for
#             prompt_id() below.
