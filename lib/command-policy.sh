# lib/command-policy.sh — "is the shell command behind this prompt something
# peer automation may auto-answer, or does it need a human?"
#
# docs/control-plane-design.md's review correction 8: peer automation (an
# agent auto-pressing herdr-select.sh's option key on ANOTHER agent's
# behalf) may only answer OPERATIONAL prompts. Destructive, credential,
# production, or scope-changing prompts must ESCALATE to the human — never
# get auto-approved just because they happen to look like a tool-approval
# menu. This file is that boundary: it classifies the raw shell text behind
# a prompt, and every caller must treat anything but a bare "allow" as "do
# not auto-answer this."
#
# Provides: scannable_command <cmd>   -> normalized text on stdout
#           classify_command <cmd>    -> verdict token (allow|escalate|deny)
#           classify_reason           -> reason for the last classify_command
#
# Ported in spirit from yc-software/qm's src/policy/command-policy.ts — same
# five floor rules, same normalize-before-match shape — reimplemented here
# in bash because that is what herdr-select.sh is written in.
set -uo pipefail

# Every real caller captures classify_command's verdict via command
# substitution — `verdict=$(classify_command "$cmd")` — because the verdict
# token IS its stdout per the contract above. Command substitution forks a
# SUBSHELL: any plain variable classify_command sets there (e.g. a
# "last reason") dies with that subshell the instant `$(...)` returns, so a
# naive in-memory "last reason" reads back empty on the very next line —
# classify_reason runs back in the ORIGINAL shell, which never saw the
# assignment happen. `$$` is the one thing bash keeps stable across that
# fork (unlike $BASHPID, which is per-subshell), so a tiny file keyed by it
# bridges classify_command's subshell back to classify_reason's call in the
# parent. One file, overwritten every call — not a durable log, just enough
# to survive one fork; PIDs recycle, so nothing here grows unbounded.
#
# Lives under a 0700 directory, not the shared /tmp, and the path itself is
# not attacker-predictable-and-preseedable in the way a bare
# $TMPDIR/name.$$.reason would be: a co-resident user on a multi-user Linux
# box (macOS's TMPDIR is already a private per-user 0700 directory) could
# otherwise pre-create that exact path as a symlink to a victim file before
# this PID exists, and the plain `>` redirect below would follow it and
# clobber whatever it points at.

# rule (or none) up to deny — see the operator-rules section below. Keeping
# the strictest match (and its reason) as we go, instead of returning early,
# is what makes that "only ever tightens" invariant hold structurally rather
# than needing a special case.
