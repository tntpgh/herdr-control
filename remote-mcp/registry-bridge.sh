# registry-bridge.sh — the one place remote-mcp/tasks.py (Python) reaches
# into lib/run-registry.sh (bash functions, not a CLI) for the writes it has
# no other entry point for. Reads of a single row go through here too, so a
# future schema change updates one JSON shape instead of two parsers.
#
# Deliberately narrow: starting and completing a task already have real
# entry points (spawn-task.sh, close-done-workers.sh) that tasks.py calls
# directly as subprocesses — this exists only for set_task_remote_id /
# set_task_deadline / set_task_verified (no other caller needs them) and a
# forced cancel (explicit cancel_task / timed_out, which must NOT go through
# close-done-workers.sh's safe-autoclose gate: a cancel means give up now,
# dirty worktree or not).
#
#   registry-bridge.sh read <run_id> <task_id>
#   registry-bridge.sh read-by-remote <remote_task_id>
#   registry-bridge.sh set-remote-id <run_id> <task_id> <remote_task_id>
#   registry-bridge.sh set-deadline <run_id> <task_id> <deadline_iso>
#   registry-bridge.sh set-verified <run_id> <task_id> 0|1 [detail]
#   registry-bridge.sh cancel <run_id> <task_id> <reason>
#
# Every subcommand prints JSON (the row) or nothing, and exits nonzero on
# failure — tasks.py checks the return code, never scrapes stderr text.
